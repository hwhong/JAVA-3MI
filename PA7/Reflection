What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project was a huge step up from the previous few projects, mainly because we delved into the manipulating sound. Similar
to manipulating pixels, we also had to read from a sound file and get its values such as frequency and amplitude. Another 
important thing that I learned was the concept of dynamically uses user's information to change the workings of the program, 
(namely the scanner).

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- concatenating the sound files and thinking of edge cases were quite a challenge. 

Note to future Warren (lol)
- mind blown by the fact that sound can also be an array.
