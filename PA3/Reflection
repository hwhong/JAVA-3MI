What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project is quite intersting to me. This is the first time that I really started to understand what coding could do. 
In previous assignments, everything were based on moving a turtle object in a window. Though it is quite cool to see that 
simply by place one line of code, I could move the turtle three steps forward or one step back, I never really experience the
power of coding until now. In this project, my partner and I manipulated picture pixels and become more familiar with the 
concept of arrays. 

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- I think the most trouble we had was knowing when to place which construct. 

Note to future Warren (lol)
- Manipulating pictures is really fun. Maybe you could do something that mimics one of the instagram filters.
