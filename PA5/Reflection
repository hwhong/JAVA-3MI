What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project was very challenging. I learned quite a lot about how copying from one picture to another works. I also learned
about the idea of green screen and its working. By locating a specific pixel and retrieve its level of greeness(?) we will be 
able to then change the color of that pixel by copying from another pixel.

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- keeping track with the pixels of two different pictures at the same time was quite challenging mainly because there are
specific patches that we needed to change. 

Note to future Warren (lol)
- this operation of using green screen and applying different picture onto the green screen is cool. You can look more into 
how movies do what they do.
