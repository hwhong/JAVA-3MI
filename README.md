# JAVA-3MI
Documentation of my journey to become a better java programmer! 
This repository documents some of the projects I have done in school along with my reflection of these projects.
This repository only includes the projects I've done in my first 3 months with coding (hence 3MI[3 Months In]!), so that I could better document my progression. 

Reflections include: 
- What I've learned from doing the project 
- What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment 
- Note to future Warren (lol)
